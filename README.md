Patched encom font

The font is sourced from an archived version of http://disneydigitalbooks.go.com/tron. leveraging the

It has been patched such that the missing lowercase characters simply mirror the existing capital ones.
This allows for easy use with applications such as [polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar).
